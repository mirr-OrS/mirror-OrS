Hi OwO, I'm an intermediate in python and C,
trying to grasp assembly level of understanding,
because as a wise man said once:

"Everything is open-source... 
if you can read assembly!"

XD just kidding, but bootloaders are kind of complex :\
... I think you understood why I learned C, python's there just
because it got me started on programming, oh btw, I ***know*** 
*what AI code looks like, I know so should no one ever send me
**that** kind of code!* >:)
